        AniTRACE is an anime scene tracer web app built using trace.moe and Jikan APIs. It allows users to upload an image
        taken from an anime scene to get its title and other details. This project aims to help anime fans and watchers to
        get anime sauce from social media posts or other platforms that doesnâ€™t indicate the title of the anime series or
        movie.
